fbreader (0.12.9dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  The information on all books is moved from XML files to the SQLite database.
  This migration work is executed once on the first launch of the new version
  of FBReader.
  The migration includes some correction of tags, for which FBReader needs
  an access to the books. Thus, before the first launch of the new FBReader
  version it is strongly recommended to attach all removable mass storages
  on which books are stored.

  Qt3 interface for fbreader (the package libzlui-qt) is not built anymore.
  Use Qt4 interface (the package libzlui-qt4) instead.
